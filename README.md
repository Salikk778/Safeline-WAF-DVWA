## üîê Web Application Attack & Defense Lab: DVWA on LAMP with WAF


## üìñ Overview

This is a step-by-step homelab project where I deployed, secured, and tested a vulnerable DVWA web application using a Web Application Firewall (SafeLine WAF).  
It covers full-stack configuration, simulated attacks (**SQLi, XSS,DoS,Cmd Injection, File Upload**, etc.), and defensive measures (WAF rules, **SSL, IP blocking, log analysis**).

---

## üß∞ Environment Setup

- **Virtualization:** VirtualBox
- **Networking Mode:** Bridged
- **Target VM:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (LAMP + DVWA)
- **Attacker VM:** Kali Linux
- **WAF:** SafeLine WAF (reverse proxy)
  
---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Installing and Configuring LAMP Stack

Install Apache2, PHP, and MySQL:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 mysql-server php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
```

Secure the MySQL Installation:

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

 ## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Installing and Configuring Damn Vulnerable Web App
(DVWA)

```bash
cd /var/www/html
sudo git clone https://github.com/digininja/DVWA.git
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data DVWA
```

Configure database in **config.inc.php**:
```bash
$_DVWA[ 'db_server' ]   = 'localhost';
$_DVWA[ 'db_database' ] = 'dvwa';
$_DVWA[ 'db_user' ]     = 'dvwa_user';
$_DVWA[ 'db_password' ] = 'p@ssw0rd';
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Setting up MySQL for DVWA

```bash
CREATE DATABASE dvwa;
CREATE USER 'dvwa_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'p@ssw0rd';
GRANT ALL ON dvwa.* TO 'dvwa_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Changing the DVWA Listening Port to 8080
 
By default, Apache listens on port 80. To change it to 8080:

‚óè Edit the Apache Configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/ports.conf
```
Change:

Listen 80
=>
Listen 8080

‚óè Update Virtual Host Configuration

Open the default virtual host file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
```
Change <VirtualHost *:80> to <VirtualHost *:8080>.

‚óè Restart Apache
```bash

sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
‚úÖ DVWA is now accessible at:

```bash
http://<Ubuntu_IP>:8080/DVWA
```

‚óè **Initialize DVWA:**

Navigate to http://<Ubuntu IP>/DVWA/setup.php in your browser.
Click Create/Reset Database.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ DNS Resolution Setup

 Using /etc/hosts for Local Resolution

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
Add the following line at the end (replace <Ubuntu_IP> with the actual IP of your Ubuntu server):

```bash
<Ubuntu_IP> dvwa.local
```

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a Self-Signed SSL Certificate
To enable HTTPS on DVWA through the WAF, generate a self-signed SSL certificate on the Ubuntu server.

```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/ssl/dvwa
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
-keyout /etc/ssl/dvwa/dvwa.key \
-out /etc/ssl/dvwa/dvwa.crt
```

This creates the certificate and private key in /etc/ssl/dvwa/.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Installing and Configuring SafeLine WAF
SafeLine WAF is deployed as a reverse proxy to protect the DVWA application.

üî∑ 7.1 Automatic Deployment

Run the official install script on the Ubuntu server:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSLk https://waf.chaitin.com/release/latest/manager.sh)" -- --en
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to complete installation, you will be shown:

 ‚óè Admin username & password

 ‚óè WAF Management URL typically on port 9443
 
 
![SafeLine Install](screenshots/safeline-install.png)


üî∑ 7.2 Importing the Self-Signed Certificate

Log in to the SafeLine WAF web interface and upload the SSL certificate you generated:

‚óè Certificate File: /etc/ssl/dvwa/dvwa.crt

‚óè Key File: /etc/ssl/dvwa/dvwa.key



## 8Ô∏è‚É£  Onboarding the DVWA Application

Use the SafeLine WAF management console to add a new application:

**DNS Name:** dvwa.local

**Backend URL (reverse proxy):** http://<UbuntuIP>:8080 

Delete port 80; only enable port 443

**Virtual Host:** dvwa.local

Attach the SSL Certificate (if you want the WAF to serve HTTPS).

## üß™ Attack Simulations & WAF Defense ##

This section documents the attacks performed using the DVWA web interface from the Kali Linux attacker VM, and how SafeLine WAF **detected, logged, and blocked** them.
The WAF security levels were adjusted to observe different blocking thresholds, and additional custom defenses were configured through the WAF GUI.

üî∑ Attacks Performed via DVWA:

The following attacks were executed by navigating DVWA‚Äôs vulnerable modules and submitting crafted payloads:

| Attack Type                    | Payload / Method                         | WAF Action         |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **SQL Injection**              | `' OR '1'='1`                            | ‚úÖ Blocked & logged |
| **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** | `<script>alert(1)</script>`              | ‚úÖ Blocked & logged |
| **Command Injection**          | `127.0.0.1; ls -la`                      | ‚úÖ Blocked & logged |
| **File Upload (PHP Shell)**    | Uploaded `shell.php` disguised as `.jpg` | ‚úÖ Blocked & logged |
| **HTTP Flood (DoS)**           | Excessive requests from Kali using DVWA  | ‚úÖ Blocked & logged |


![Command Injection Attack](screenshots/cmd-injection-attack.jpg)


‚úÖ After each attack, the WAF logs were reviewed to confirm detection and identify attacker details (source IP, timestamp, attack type).

## üî∑ WAF Security Levels

The WAF‚Äôs security level was adjusted (Low ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí High) to observe how strictness impacted detection and blocking.
Higher levels resulted in more aggressive blocking of suspicious patterns.

## üî∑ Additional WAF Protections

**‚úÖ Authentication Gateway**

Enabled authentication on the DVWA endpoint to require login before accessing the app.
Verified that unauthenticated requests were blocked at the WAF.

**‚úÖ Custom Deny Rules**

Added a deny rule for the Kali VM IP (192.168.x.x) to completely block the attacker.

**‚úÖ HTTP Flood Defense(DoS)**

Configured thresholds & penalties to mitigate DoS attacks.
Verified that excessive requests were detected and blocked.
